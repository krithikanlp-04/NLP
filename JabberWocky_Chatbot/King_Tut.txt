"TUT" is a secret spelling language which is used in the United States by slaves to converse without the knowledge of their masters. 
It is also called Double Dutch or Tutney. Each spelling language uses a special alphabet in which the letters have new sounds, syllables or phonemes assigned to them. This language is like a substitution cipher which enables only people who know the alphabet to understand the conversations
