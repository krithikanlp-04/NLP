The Name game is a fun rhyming musical game which takes a name and creates a verse out of it. The general template for the song goes 

"John" "John", bo-bohn
banana-fana fo-fohn
fee-fi-mo-mohn
John!

For names beginning with vowels, there is no trimming done. 
For names beginning with consonants, the onset of the first syllable is clipped and the remaining stem is attached to the nonsense verses. 
For names beginning with consonants in the rhyme ie B, F, or M, the onset of the first syllable is clipped and the remaining stem is attached to the nonsense verses, while also dropping the starting letter from the infixation point.

For example 
Names: Earl, Burt, Michael, Flint

Earl, Earl, bo-bearl
banana-fana fo-fearl
fee-fi-mo-mearl
