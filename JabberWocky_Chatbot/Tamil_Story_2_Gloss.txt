The tortoise, resting under a tree where a bird had built a nest, spoke to the bird in the tree. Then the tortoise joked that the bird 's nest was not beautiful and that it was built of ugly, broken sticks. But the tile on her back, which is her home, is said to be strong with the right shape.

The bird that heard it broke my nest and made myself with materials available in nature, even though it was ugly; He replied that he liked it very much.

And the tortoise told the bird that your nest is no better than his nest. The bird that hears it is better than its nest; Because his family and friends can live with him in this nest; But she happily replied that no one but you could enter your nest.

Justice: Living in a small cottage with relatives and friends is better than living alone in a large bungalow!
